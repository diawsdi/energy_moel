# Enhanced Grid Visualization

This document outlines the proposed enhanced grid visualization features for the Senegal Energy Infrastructure Visualization system, detailing implementation approaches, benefits, and technical requirements.

## Feature Overview

The Enhanced Grid Visualization feature aims to create a more realistic, informative, and interactive representation of the electricity transmission network by improving the visualization of grid lines and substations, their connections, and the flow of electricity through the network.

## Key Components

### 1. Network Topology Enhancement

**Description:**  
Improve the representation of the electricity network as a connected graph where substations (nodes) and transmission lines (edges) form a coherent system.

**Implementation:**
- Process grid_lines data to ensure proper connectivity with grid_nodes
- Implement snapping algorithm to connect line endpoints precisely to substation points
- Store explicit node-to-line relationships in the database
- Add metadata about connections (type, capacity, status)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Spatial processing using GeoPandas/PostGIS
- Database schema updates to store topology relationships
- Data validation to ensure network integrity

### 2. Realistic Line Styling

**Description:**  
Enhance the visual representation of transmission lines to convey more information about their properties and status.

**Implementation:**

**Implementation:**
- Hover effects to highlight connected infrastructure
- Network tracing to show upstream/downstream connections
- Click interactions to show detailed information about network segments
- Filtering options to focus on specific voltage levels or infrastructure types

**Technical Requirements:**
- Event handling in MapLibre GL JS
- Client-side graph algorithms for network traversal
- Optimized data structures for quick lookups

### 4. Power Flow Visualization

**Description:**  
Visualize the flow of electricity through the network to help understand load distribution, potential bottlenecks, and system capacity.

**Implementation:**
- Directional indicators on lines showing power flow
- Color gradients representing load levels
- Animated flow patterns showing electricity movement
- Time-based visualization showing changes throughout the day/year

**Technical Requirements:**
- Power flow simulation data integration
- Temporal data handling
- Advanced animation techniques
- Performance optimization for complex visualizations
